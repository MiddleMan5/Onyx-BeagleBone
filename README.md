# Onyx-BeagleBone

This is one of my many side projects and represents my understanding of Robotics, Mechanical design, Electrical systems, Software development, and embedded development.

Onyx is a standard, symmetrical X-body type quadruped robot. Currently, CAD models are existent up until MK1.

Mark 2 development is underway, but may be branched due to limited resources and the necessity for a complete redesign according to specified task or machining restraints.
