The program Main.cpp provides entrance into the Robot's controls and various defined functions. 
Main.cpp defines runtime operations and State control. The Program takes arguments from a separate Control-HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)
    
    The robot only provides the ability to walk, the program decides when to stop a walk and when to start one.
    The Program provides movement and data-collection parameters, the Control-HAL then translates input from the Host-HAL to instruct the program.

The Robot creates a System containing one or more mechanisms and their various controllers. These can be switched by a power controller (Note: Systems aren't required to have power controllers)
Power controllers access the Host-HAL directly (Usually as a call to GPIO(Pin, State);)

If a power controller is on, then system commands are passed transparently to the Mechanism. The Mechanism commands Links to perform various actions with there subservient actuators.

These Actuators directly control the Host-HAL which provides a feedback to the Control HAL.

OMFG WHY IS THIS SO HARD!!!?
